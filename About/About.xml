  <description>A 1.3 port of an old mod that adds clothing, power buildings, weapons (among other things) that are centered around the theme of Industral Revolution. So expect a lot of steam-powered machines if you're into that.

Original mod can be found here:
https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?PHPSESSID=fe7834866dd2c1d79f8e87d999b8b42f&topic=33189.0

Known issues:
- [strike] the textures for clothes do not load properly, I tried using Graphic_Multi, Graphic_StackCount and Graphic_Single but it always resulted in purple squares as textures and glitched pawn apperance in colonist bar [/strike]
- [strike] the mod throws an error ever time the faction&settlement name giver tries to execute [/strike]
- does not show in mod menu as 1.3 compatible and dosen't show 1.3 tag in workshop, loads fine in the game though
